#### The Extendable _Reactive Virtual DOM_ Renderer
**Atom-iQ** Core library is a main, required library of the **Atom-iQ** framework. It could also act
independently, as lightweight DOM rendering library, but it's recommended to use it with additional,
optional framework packages, that's making complete front-end ecosystem.

The Core library is including **Reactive Virtual DOM Renderer**, **Component's** state creation
functions, utility for composing **Middlewares** (Renderer and Components extension) and main
type definitions for the framework.
